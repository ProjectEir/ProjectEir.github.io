        <p>
          Medicine has gone through a millenary history. In the Ancient Greece
          this noble science had its very birth, with Hippocrates, whose
          eponymous oath is still the starting point for every initiate doctor;
          everything was based on divine revelations, taken from god Asclepius
          (rom. Aesculapius), mixed with first anatomical intuitions, which had
          no scientific explanation at the time. All of this was followed by
          several centuries of medieval heresies, where medicine research was
          often confused and overlaid with religion.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the end of 14th century, the rise of the Renaissance gave new pulse
          to the more scientific approach, which lead to first actually
          anatomical discoveries. The lack of quick info diffusion devices
          prevented the spread of knowledge until the early 16th century, when
          Johannes Gutenberg invented the mobile printing system, making books,
          thus culture, more accessible. After this, a huge step forward is
          necessary, towards the invention of the Internet, which made available
          a limitless amount of knowledge in a ludicrously little amount of
          time. But how to keep orientation in this unexplored sea of knowledge?

          For this project we had three main stack holders, researcher,
          civilians and medical personnel. Another possible stakeholder could
          also be investors. Due to the short amount of time did we decide to
          focus on researches. After a meating with one of the stakeholder (a
          researcher) could we conclude that the main goal is to get a good
          overview as well as detailed information about a specific trail.
          Another important task was to find trends in the field of research.
        </p>
        <blockquote><p class="promo-caption">Visual mappings</p></blockquote>
        <p>
          We brainstormed alot about the visual mapping. Out data scaled
          extreamly fast from one dimension to the next. There are around twenty
          categories and in the text level thousends of diseases, and every
          disease could have all the vay from 1 to thousends of trails. In total
          does our database include Ã¶ver 2.5 milion nodes.
        </p>
        <p>
          We decided to use a icicle as our main categorization tool. Originaly
          we tought of a sankey diagram but due to some difficoulties with
          getting it to work, did we switch to the icicle, Howerver, we are very
          satisfied with how the icicle turned out. For the more details
          overview did we use a parallell coodrinates. It can easily reperesent
          multiple variables while still alowing for comparison.
        </p>
        <h3 class="header center-align">The result</h3>

        <blockquote><p class="promo-caption">Description</p></blockquote>

        <p>
          The result is an Icicle to selet a specific category or disease. We
          have a filter option aswell as a search bar. The Breadcrumb helps the
          user to navigate and the parallell coordinates allow the user to
          compare and find more detaild information.
